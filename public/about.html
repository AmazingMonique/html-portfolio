<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Monica Elpo, my friends and everybody calls me Monique and I think it's super cool. I mean, Monique sounds so chic, don't you agree? Anyways, if someone told me I "d be building websites say 3 months ago, I would have had their heads checked but hey! here i am.</p>

<p>Learning programming has changed my life one HTML tag after the other, especially with the most amazing tutor. Angela Yu is super amazing and is the reason I am liking the idea of being a programmer more and more by the day.</p>

<p>So far in this course I have learned basic concepts as it relates to HTML, from tags to elements to attributes, I have also had the privilege of working on different assignments to test my understanding of all the concepts taught. While I am not fully formed as a developer yet, I can boldly say that I am well on my way to being there and will continue to give learning and upskilling my best shot.</p>
