<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Monica Elpo, my friends and everybody calls me Monique and i think it's super cool. i mean Monique sounds so chick, don't you agree?. Anyways, if someone told me i"d be building websites say 3 months ago, i would definitely have had their heads checked but hey! here i am</p>

<p>Learning programming has changed my life one html tag after the other, especially with me having the most amazing tutor. Angela Yu is super amazing and is tye reason i am liking the idea of being a programmer more and more by the day.</p>

<p>So far in this course i have learnt basic concepts as it relates to HTML, from tags to elements to attributes, i have also had the privilege of working on different asignments to test my understanding of all the concepts taught. While i am not fully formed as a developer yet, i can boldly say that ni am well on my way to being there and will continue to give learning and upskilling my best shot.</p>
